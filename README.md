# Customer Attrition

Customer attrition or customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients. 
Telephone service companies, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of 
their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. 
Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, 
because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.
